<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>
<p>
The first thing we will need to do is create an issue that needs to be resolved. I have created three separate topics that detail IT relatd issues as if they were real life problems. Users must log in, create a ticket by using the Help Topic tab, detailing the issue they have and submit it. <br />

From the admin side, the tickets will appear on their panel once they have logged into work for the day. From there, they can assign tickets to the necessary team or agent. They will determine the severity of the issue to ensure that the ticket is resolved within proper SLA guidelines. The tickets have been viewed and assigned to the System Administrators. The severity of each ticket has also been changed.

<p>
It is important to communicate with your team if you are unsure of how to resolve the issue. YOu should also let your client or customer know that. Clear communication is paramount when dealing with their IT issue. osTicket also records when a ticket is assigned to someone else within the organization. All tickets are stored and saved just in case a simialar issue appears in the future. 
</p>
<h2>Final Word</h2>
<p>
Every ticket will fall into a certain SLA category, depending on it's severity. Some are more important or emergent than others and may need to be dealt with within a certain amount of time.
